      "First of all, I’ll tell you, and I totally understand the problem that we’re having. You know, the gangsters tell you that the problem we’re having comes from illegal immigration, and that’s absolutely true. The fact is that a hundred years ago, people that crossed the border bought guns, and bought drugs, and that’s a big problem because they kind of knew that drugs were being used here.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem is—I mean, I don’t want to mince words, we have to solve it. We have to have a wall. A wall is not going to be put up by anybody, because it cannot be put up by anybody. And every little gang, every little criminal gang that has crossed the border, they go down and go, “Oh we’re not very good,” and they flee over to Mexico, and they go down and we have a problem and we have a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have a situation where the problem is, the problem is going to get worse, and so we have to continue to solve the problem, and the solution right now is a great wall, and I promise you we’ll be spending a lot of money on it.\n",

      "Throughout the debate, Trump has tried to push the fine point, and he's failed. U.S. Homeland Security Janet Napolitano did talk about the wall during Thursday’s debate, but it’s just a debate, and it seems unlikely that Trump is able to repeat a promise made during the first debate.<|endoftext|>To stop the growth of national debt, the US must use eight –out of 10 houses the nation has– in time to pay off all of the United States’ outstanding national debt over the next decade, congressional Democrats said today.\n",

In September, however, things have not met the hype expectations.\n",

      "Saturday against Wyoming, Jack Conklin looked ready for this game, and he proved it by catching passes on the ground for a 44-yard touchdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was his first start since the NIU game, and he came to the game after throwing for 178 total yards and a touchdown in the bowl game at Northern Illinois. The Wolverines eventually won that game, 24-20, and their confidence in Conklin, a transfer from Norfolk State, was back in the lineup for Saturday against Wyoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June, knee surgery caused Conklin to miss the 100-yard dash. He missed the better part of a week of practice, had a week of surgery to repair the torn cartilage, and entered this year’s bowl game against Wyoming relatively unscathed since the surgery. The defense did its job well, but the offensive line finally got in the way and lost the battle 20-0 to Northern Illinois.\n",
      "\n",
      "With 6:22 left in the first quarter, Conklin began to get out of his stance and get open enough to get in on the first down. He had a chance to throw the ball downfield and the Wolverines were mopping up after the weak NIU offense. The Bears had nine rushing yards.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took NIU’s Casey Troup and Rashad Hatfield to put up enough pressure to hit Conklin in the air with a pass. Conklin hit Ryan McCormick on a 32 yard reception and caught the ball three times. Unfortunately, Conklin fell to the ground after he made the catch. Wyoming held on for a play on the score and the Wolverines left with a turnover. Scoreless loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next week, the Wolverines scored big against Wisconsin against Maryland, put up big points against Indiana, and shut down a tough team in Wyoming. Should this team have relied on a guy like Jack Conklin for the big game against Wyoming? (Have I missed it, but Wyoming was the game I feared the most?) They should have given Conklin a try. He was overlooked in this one, and had 10 minutes to play before the Broncos settled for a field goal on the final possession of the game. They didn’t capitalize, and they were never able to muster a point in Wyoming.\n",

He also made a couple of bad throws at the line of scrimmage in a 27-20 overtime loss to Penn State and called for a flag. In 2016 against Purdue, he threw an interception on the final drive and fumbled, while catching three passes for 51 yards. He has now caught 19 of his 33 passes for 502 yards and a touchdown this season.\n",

      "That’s why Conklin has been having so of problems. I mean, if the Wolverines were lined a block differently, there should have been a big rush in the third quarter. He’s confusing defenses. It is easier for the defense to stop him when he is throwing the ball outside and underneath, and harder for the defense to figure out what to do instead. With this quarterback, you want him to throw the ball when he needs it most, put it outside the defense, and get some big plays. (If he catches the ball out of bounds, I’m sure most defenses will have a harder time stopping him.)\n",

In April 1954, the Texas State Legislature passed a law that required that a defendant have to plead guilty in court first, and allow them to be sentenced to a maximum sentence of 15 years. Marshall later recanted his confession, and said the state had given a lot less evidence. Steven Carpenter in his book, The Case (1996) wrote, \"Marshall would not have presented so much evidence had he not spent years in jail, and later when all the witnesses testified, he used three stages of confession, without admitting the crimes to police as well as without admitting to the jury the actual murder, trying to find some more testimony to bolster his case against the police.\"[25] In an interview with Jay Bender of the Dallas Star on February 20, 1957, Marshall said, \"Kathleen Price did not have the desire for her son, probably Mark Price, to commit a murder. But to me it was William Price who apparently had the desire for desire. The future excuses of William Price were so self-serving that he begged a $1.5 million jury and not went to jail.\"[26]\n",

      "Stephen Webb was the second one charged in the investigation. In March 1953, Webb went to federal court and requested his release from the Dallas County Jail after a nine-year stay. He wrote a series of articles about brutal eyewitness corroboration and crime patterns, some of which he shared with newspapers such as the (Kansas) Wichita Eagle. Government reporter Samuel S. Arnott had published one of his articles in the Amarillo, Texas Morning Star in 1956.\n",

      "In 1953, Mr. Webb was released not because he was innocent, but because he was going to be executed for murder, and so he was transferred from custody to death row. His next punishment was to die.[27]\n",

      "After that, Webb was incarcerated for several years. Then in 1963, he was moved from the Dallas County Jail to the State Penitentiary in Hartford, a move Governor Walter Austin denounced as unconstitutional. He was moved in 1961 to a state prison in Columbus, Georgia.[28]\n",

Reynolds, Amos Marks, Linus Evans, Roderick Peters, Robert Newton Worthington, K.H. Bishop and John A. Harrington, who made public comments about his severe post-traumatic stress disorder on the day of the murders.[30] The others were: Clarence Givens, Franklin E. Henderson, Charles A. Ramsey, Franklin W. Criggs, Albert B. Johnson, Bryan Brown, Willard R. King, Mark Gonzales, Albert Jackson, Vincent Hopkins, William J. Rood Schmidt, David King, Francis Coffman, James Bacon, Francis Coffman, Clyde Chesnut, Edward Coombs, James H. Hudson, William Bell, Sean McSweeney, Jack Larson, Paul J. Lewis, David S.

      "\n",
      "In the early stages of the FBI investigations, experts had noted the lack of evidence. For example, the accounts of marshals and police officers were dramatically contradicted in part due to lack of evidence. When a special agent was killed, the media took pictures of the jail showing them rather than the agents' bodies.[31] One FBI source suggested that the ATF network was the network of an organized crime ring.[32]\n",

We will continue to grow our bus fleet to serve more riders as more buses are leased.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The report also calls for 200 streetcars to operate in the coming years, which the TTC says means riders will better know the schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff report backs the expansion, and notes that it is all part of the TTC's ridership plan. It says the network delivers 260,000 riders per hour during weekday rush hours and peak times, when ridership is low and real times are crucial. The reality is that the streetcar extension will carry about 200 buses per hour, which could mean fewer riders during peak hours. When the ridership extension in the first half of 2016 began service, the average was 105,000 riders at peak times, but dropped to 89,000 as service was introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff also said the the expansion would not have been possible during the Rob Ford era. But less than nine months after re-election, staff poured millions of dollars into a build-to-market strategy, a new Etobicoke Centre and an expansion of the relief line.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And that can be even more challenging for students in general. It's become a stereotype that students today are ill-prepared for the workforce. And I think that will be a trend over time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "More college students are becoming aware that the degrees they've gotten affect them more than the amount of pay they've earned since completing their education. Without them, the mental burden and stress on college students are going to continue to grow in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A student's education does not impact their ability to get a job because the job market experience they need to get isn't directly related to their training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students' college schooling isn't tied to their experience in the job market, so there's no way it makes college graduates unemployable. And in fact, there's no way they'll never get the best job that they can get. In an era of stagnant labor wages, many students are taking lower-paying jobs and they're more likely to drop out of school because their degrees isn't relevant to better-paying jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real takeaway for employers, though, is that it's important that students stay in the job market so that they can gain some knowledge, acquire some skills to acclimate those skills, and gain some experience to help them ultimately get the kind of job they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Money is a problem\n",
      "\n",
      "When students go to college, it's training that helps them get the best job that they can get, otherwise they don't have money. In the last 50 years, professors have said that demand for their courses and that money make a difference in the life of those who take them. In fact, roughly 40 percent of college students are unemployed before they have enough money for their post-secondary education.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a hell of a lot worse to not have enough money. Of course, there are students who spend too much money for their degrees, and universities and colleges shouldn't impose money limits on these students; they should just say yes to support as well as tuition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, not all of students' education requirements are specific to what they practice. If you teach one skill rather than a combination of skills, you should understand that students aren't likely to want that combination of specialized skills to eventually get a good job.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you teach multiple skills, they're probably going to come up with a better value,\" says Alpert, who has extensively studied this issue. \"But if you're teaching one skill rather than a combination of skills, they won't want to try.\"\n",
