      "Analysts have seen the lack of efforts to reduce use of coal as a major problem for China’s innovation drive, also known as clean energy. The country wants to develop the world’s largest renewable power capacity but relies on coal as its primary energy. According to Greenpeace International, China burned nearly 5 billion metric tons of coal in 2009. Many coal-fired power plants were closed during the 2008 global financial crisis and emission cuts imposed by the West.\n",

If this trend were to continue and as the economic outlook further deteriorates, the world’s energy demand could easily be around 10 percent higher than last year’s forecasts.”<|endoftext|>Last week Cardinal Brayer said that “he [Pope Francis] calls attention to the most fundamental truths that have been revealed to us by God.” According to the pope, same-sex marriage depends on the acceptance of one’s own sexual partner, and on a commitment to recognize that there are other relationships they have with each other.\n",

Thus, the pope is working to create a society in which Catholics who want to live where they are married, and who find it difficult or unable to travel to another country because they cannot marry people who were made for them, will be able to create and have children.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, Cardinal Brayer told The New York Times that the pope’s message was clear. Marriage, he said, is “not only a matter of how many years a couple has to be in love. It is a matter of how happy, mutually meaningful relationships surround marriage.” The pope was more explicit. “This isn’t about marriage. This is about love for one another,” he said, according to The Sunday Times. “Why should people spend their whole lives looking for someone who will love them?” Cardinal Brayer—who was a Prefect of the Bishops until his resignation in 2003, and if he remembers correctly, is not especially anti-abortion—gave the Times reporter a final declaration: “That is what the story is, and the pope is simply a celebration of that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "P asked about his hopes, Cardinal Brayer also said that he wants Pope Francis to refrain from giving homosexuality advice to young Catholics. “How then can such limitations on a person’s freedom contribute to developing his or her capacity for thought? Can you teach someone how to vote and not how to think?” he said. Maybe the pope will say it now, but “he should do it for the good of humanity, for the good of culture.”\n",

We’ve gotten massive amounts of positive feedback not on the network’s presentation of the pilot, but from the critics and the fans who’ve been very impressed with the show. There’s audiences that have grown on the show. It’s huge. It’s amazing. And when we first started, we really stumbled out of the gate and we were like, ‘Oh, okay, we need to do something else.’ And then, all of a sudden, the word started getting out.”\n",

I’m also excited, you know, about now having a second season.”\n",

      "“No, it’s been one of those things, where you’re the only one who’s not looking and thinking, ‘What are we going to do all over again?

And the feedback from a lot of the critics and the fans. The Atmospheres have just been really good really. And I just really poured all of my energy into it. The feedback has been tremendous.

      "<|endoftext|> harmonisation would inevitably bring. The document, adopted at a crunch meeting in Brussels in March, calls on meetings of EU finance ministers and member states to agree on a new blueprint focussing on stability, with the aim of creating a single euro zone. The move caused a swift backlash from politicians in Britain and France, who had argued that a single euro zone would solve the single currency bloc’s concerns about euro-area stability. A finance ministry spokesman said that the new blueprint would be focused on three main issues: the creation of a single euro zone, banking union, and a proposal to create a supervisory board to pick up rules across the bloc. “This is something we have been working on for the last few years. There are lots of ideas, and it doesn’t need to be new,” he said. The blueprint refers to a separate European proposal to have an independent supervisory board take over supervision of banks and lenders rejected by France in December. It was unclear whether this was an option for Britain or France – optional or conditional on Britain’s membership of the single currency bloc, as Britain has repeatedly rejected talks on the issue. “We are not talking about questioning whether Britain should leave the euro. We are talking about a supervisory board and actually putting that together. We need to have a strong structure to deal with risks and to have a transnational structure,” said Juncker. But many of other EU leaders did not share that view. European Central Bank chief Mark Carney said she did not necessarily think Britain wanted to leave the euro but that it meant greater autonomy for the single currency area and that the bloc needed to address its severe fiscal crisis. Ukip leader Nigel Farage welcomed the move. “No matter what happens we will have changes. No matter what the outcome, we are going to have a change, not just in the area, but in the rest of the EU, in policy and culture,” Farage said at an event in Strasbourg, France. “We will be trying again and again to work out how we can make this happen. And if we can do it as a broad group, we will do it.”<|endoftext|>The sudden end of the Cold War saw the final break-up of the European Union. Due to the financial inability and political incapacity of the EU to stop the economic, social and cultural losses caused by the USSR and turmoil in the region, it was necessary to create political spheres of influence to fight Russia. Sixty years later, the risks of a war with Russia are so high that Europeans are rejecting the idea of a prosperous and democratic Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU’s failed-economic policies are causing economic and social stagnation, and have pushed the population suffering to a new level. So, the threat of military action by the European states against Russian military, the most powerful country in the world, may become a bigger danger in the eyes of the European people, than war with Russia. If this risk comes true, a humanitarian catastrophe will be imposed which Europe has not experienced since the Cold War and will be among the deepest and existential threats to the existence of the European Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the European states have been ready or waiting since the last five years to conclude peace agreements with Russia, the second most powerful country in the world, or even to start military co-operation with Russia. The former Soviet Union is one of the main threats to the security and prosperity of the European countries. Russia is a growing and independent player in the world and even after ending the Cold War, is spending more money than the EU countries combined. Some of the European people believe that it would not be necessary for the EU to take part in a war with Russia. Because Russia is a secret enemy of the EU, many Europeans feel that merely participating in a struggle for the territorial integrity of EU member state of Ukraine is enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest results from Eurobarometer polls show that most of the Europeans have no support for existing peace agreements with Russia. The Eurobarometer polls show that half of the Europeans had expressed support for the first EU-Russia peace agreement signed after the end of the second Cold War. But in February 2014, Russian military forces were active in an indiscriminate massacre in Ukraine. Some of the European states and their partners took military and political decisions to allow the peace agreement to be suspended and to carry out these massive military actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half of the European people are against war with Russia. All Europeans today, compared to 10 years ago, are saying that a war with Russia is a serious risk. Troops’ in Ukraine resulted in many deaths, and because many Russian soldiers also died in Ukraine, the risk of a war is high. So, if countries like Germany and France continue following peace agreements with Russia and not waiting for time to fight wars with Russia, they may also be faced by Russia with the possibility of war against them. Many Europeans reject non-violent wars with Russia. Some Europeans reject Russia’s strategy and<|endoftext|>\n",
